- [ ] Confirm streaming of large files works correctly

### Concurrent Operations
- [ ] Test multiple simultaneous uploads

- [ ] Test system under load with multiple users
- [ ] Confirm database performance with many files

## 7. Maintenance Testing

### Orphaned File Cleanup
- [ ] Test cleaning orphaned files
- [ ] Verify file metadata is correctly updated
- [ ] Confirm physical files are properly removed
- [ ] Test with files in nested directories

### Storage Optimization
- [ ] Test storage optimization functionality
- [ ] Verify reporting of freed space
- [ ] Confirm file integrity after optimization
- [ ] Test with various file types and sizes

### Cache Management
- [ ] Verify cache clearing works correctly
- [ ] Test caching headers for different file types
- [ ] Confirm cache expiration works as expected

## 8. Integration Testing

### API Integration
- [ ] Test all API endpoints with correct parameters
- [ ] Verify error handling for invalid requests
- [ ] Confirm JSON responses are properly formatted
- [ ] Test API versioning (if implemented)

### External Service Integration
- [ ] Test integration with any external CDN providers
- [ ] Verify backups to external storage
- [ ] Confirm webhooks for file operations (if implemented)

## 9. Browser Compatibility

- [ ] Test in Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Verify functionality in Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Test in Edge (latest)
- [ ] Confirm basic functionality in Safari
- [ ] Verify mobile browser compatibility

## 10. Regression Testing

- [ ] Verify all existing CDN functionality still works
- [ ] Test compatibility with existing file references
- [ ] Confirm backward compatibility with older API endpoints
- [ ] Verify configuration migration works correctly

## Test Data

Use the following test data sets:

1. Small files (< 1 MB): Various document types and images
2. Medium files (1-10 MB): PDF documents, high-resolution images 
3. Large files (10-100 MB): Video files, large spreadsheets
4. Very large files (> 100 MB): Video files, database backups

## Test Environments

1. **Development Environment**
   - Local storage path
   - SQLite database
   - No caching

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Network storage path
   - SQL Server database
   - Basic caching

3. **Production Environment**
   - Production storage path
   - Production SQL Server
   - Full caching

## Test Documentation

For each test case:
1. Document test steps
2. Record expected results
3. Document actual results
4. Note any discrepancies
5. Track fixed issues
